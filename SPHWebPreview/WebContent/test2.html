         <p>	April 26 (Bloomberg) – Inflation in the German state of Saxony slowed in April as some food prices fell and energy costs
            rose at a slower pace.
         </p>
         <p>The inflation rate declined to a 13-month low of 2 percent from 2.2 percent in March, the state’s statistics office in Kamenz
            said today. Economists forecast that German inflation, calculated using a harmonized European Union method, slowed to 2.2
            percent from 2.3 percent, according to the median of 21 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. The Federal Statistics Office
            will release that report, based on data from six states, later today.
         </p>
         <p>“In the short term, everything depends on the development of oil prices,” said Joerg Lueschow, head of economics at WestLB
            AG in Dusseldorf. “If oil prices are going to sink slightly, the inflation rate is probably going to fall below 2 percent
            in the secnd half of the year.”
         </p>
         <p>European Central Bank President Mario Draghi yesterday softened his tone on the inflation outlook in the 17-nation euro area
            after oil prices eased and the sovereign debt crisis worsened, threatening to derail the region’s nascent economic recovery.
            Still, price pressures may build in Germany, Europe’s largest economy, as unemployment at a two-decade low helps workers win
            bigger pay increases and boosts consumer spending.
         </p>
         <p>In Saxony, household energy costs rose 5.2 percent in the year, with gas 7.5 percent more expensive and heating oil 6.9 percent
            dearer. Fuel prices were up 5.2 percent. Seasonal foods such as fresh vegetables were 2.7 percent cheaper than in April last
            year. Consumer prices increased 0.1 percent from March.
         </p>
         <p>The price of crude oil has dropped 5 percent in the last two months.</p>
         <p>The ECB in March forecast inflation of 2.4 percent this year, in breach of its 2 percent limit, even as it predicted the region’s
            economy will contract 0.1 percent. Euro-area inflation was 2.7 percent in March.
         </p>
         <p>ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio said yesterday that policy makers’ assessment of inflation risks has changed.</p>
         <p>“Because we see everywhere economic growth is slowing down a little bit, so we have a different perspective now on the risk
            for inflation coming from oil and commodities compared to earlier,” he told reporters in Luxembourg. “We believe that oil
            prices will not continue to go up.”
         </p>
         <p>“Risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced,” Draghi told lawmakers yesterday. Three weeks ago he warned
            of “upside risks.”
         </p>
         <p>Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann nevertheless said on April 23 that the International Monetary Fund’s forecast for euro-area
            inflation to average 2 percent this year and slow to 1.6 percent in 2013 may be too optimistic.
         </p>
         <p>“Taking into account rising energy prices and robust core inflation, prices could rise faster than the IMF expects,” Weidmann
            said. “Even if we are concerned about the impact on the peripheral countries, monetary policy makers must do what is necessary
